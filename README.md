## Outline / Notes

*  A few things I'm thinking for this lab:
* Do we have them create various enums and test them on functions they should implement within those Enums. As in functions that return back a `String` that we can test against? 

* Something similar to this, taking from Apples doc:

```swift
directionToHead = .South
switch directionToHead {
case .North:
    print("Lots of planets have a north")
case .South:
    print("Watch out for penguins")
case .East:
    print("Where the sun rises")
case .West:
    print("Where the skies are blue")
}
// Prints "Watch out for penguins"
```

* But I think we can also make it more complicated, maybe a few easy wins like that. Maybe we show them how they could create a deck of cards using Enums instead? Or will that just make them angry.. that it wasn't shown to them before they did a Blackjack lab (lol). 
* Or maybe we can make up a silly card game (doesn't have to have any UI), they make enums based off of these certain rules we lay down and the tests will test against that.
* This one is pretty open, we could even go in a completley new direction that does include some UI / fun-ness there.
